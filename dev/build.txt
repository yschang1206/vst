This document describes compiling/linking issues.

1. compiling
------------
1-1. .dram section disappear with optimization
---------------------------------------------
Description
-----------
When the optimization level is turned on (O1, O2, O3), the .dram is no longer
place as defined in the linker script, which then causes a seg fault.

Solution
-------
Remove "static" prefix for dram.

2. linking
----------
2-1. dynamic symbol table
-------------------------
Description
-----------
With the FTL compiled as shared object, the shared object will access some
VST functions. If the shared object is dynamic-linked, the symbols that it
requires will be placed in dynamic symbol table in link time. However, as we
dynamic load the shared object, the dynamic symbol will be empty if no
additional flags are set.

Solution
--------
Enable -rdynamic will put all the symbols in dynamic symbol table.

-rdynamic
   Pass the flag -export-dynamic to the ELF linker, on targets that
   support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not only
   used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed for some
   uses of "dlopen" or to allow obtaining backtraces from within a program.
