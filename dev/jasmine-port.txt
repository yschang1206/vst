This document describes the modifications to Jasmine OpenSSD.

1. mismatched pointer/integer size
----------------------------------
Description
-----------
On the Jasmine OpenSSD dev board, pointers are 32-bit; on our PC/work station,
pointers are 64-bit. Originally, some functions/macros involve casting from 
pointer to 32-bit integer and vice versa. These includes:

(target.h)
SETREG
GETREG

(flash.h)
_BSP_FSM
_BSP_INTR
_CLR_BSP_INTR

(mem_util.h)
_read_dram_xx, xx = 8, 16, 32
_write_dram_xx, xx = 8, 16, 32
_xx_bit_dram, xx = set, clr, tst
_mem_set_sram
_mem_copy

(ftl.c)
firmware_image_pages

2. porting
----------
Description
-----------
Macro functions are ported directly in header file; normal functions are ported
in port.c.

3. NULL
-------
Description
-----------
Jasmine redefine NULL as 0 and constantly use NULL to initialize some data
structure.

Solution
--------
Remove redefinition. Modify NULL with 0.

4. inclusion
------------
Description
-----------
Originally,
ftl.c include jasmine.h
jasmine.h include ftl.h
These inclusions make vst-jasmine depends on a paticular FTL.

Solution
--------
ftl.c include ftl.h
ftl.h include jasmine.h
jasmine no longer include ftl.h

5. bulid_bad_blk_list
---------------------
Description
-----------
Function build_bad_blk_list() will test scan_list, which is set by the
Jasmine installer, and cause all the bad block bit map set to 1.

Solution
--------
Mask build_bad_blk_list
